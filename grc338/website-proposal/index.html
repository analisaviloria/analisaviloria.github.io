					<h1>Our History</h1>
				
					<p>Nanang Rosa was born in Tubao, La Union, Philippines on October 2, 1925 and immigrated to the States in 1975. Whether in the Philippines or in the US, Nanang Rosa's #1 priority was to show her love for her family and friends, and she did exactly that by cooking food! Every single item on our menu has been derived from an original recipe made by our very own Nanang Rosa. So what are you waiting for? Kain na! Let's eat!</p>
